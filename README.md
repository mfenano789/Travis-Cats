Your goal in this project is to use everything you have learned in this course to create a
brand-new webpage for a friend of mine, Travis. Travis has a family of cats, and he would
like a website made just for them. He’s given a few requirements:
Layout and Design:
Each page should have a similar look and feel. The general layout is given below.
Only the main content should scroll; the header, footer, and sidebar should stay in place.
The pages should be responsive. I will be testing your pages on a smartphone as well as a
desktop. The footer should state that the page was made by you, and that the images are
supplied by “Travis Cattington.”
Each of Travis’ cats has a favourite colour. Please include each of them somewhere in your
design.
• Mona’s is magenta -
• Tenley’s is brown -
• Maxwell’s is red -
• [Rocky’s is grey] -

Main Page:
The main page should be a landing page with room for Travis’ blog posts (listed at the end
of this document). Your sidebar should have a form asking the user for their name, and
which cat is their favourite. You should use JavaScript to take this information and replace
the poll buttons with some updated results. Sample “initial” results are given below. The
sidebar should also offer navigation to each individual blog post on the page. Please use
Bootstrap badges to mark the top post as “New.” Use badges to include the other tags that
are given with the posts. Remember: when deploying a website with a real web server the
main page must be called “index.html” to be found.
The main page should be a collaborative effort between all group members.
Other Pages:
The other pages on your site should be biography pages for each of Travis’ cats. There
should be one page for each. Please include the biographies below, and three pictures of
each cat in a Bootstrap Carousel. The sidebar should contain three Bootstrap Cards each
with another picture and a description of what the cat is doing in the picture. Please give
each page a meaningful name (not page1, page2, etc).
Each group member should make their own sub-page. In the event your group has more
than three members, please use the pet rock biography in addition to Travis’ cats.
